I am an academic researcher in cognitive and affective neurosciences. My primary research interests are in mechanisms of contemplative practices, including meditation, Buddhist meditation, and compassion. I adopt various research and analytical methodologies such as fMRI, EEG, computerized tasks, and interviews in this line of work. My secondary interests are in semantics and social function, and thought dynamics and mental flexibility, where I investigate how and why people act flexibly in various situations.

Outside of research, I'm also do some mentoring, programming, data science, and UX research projects. I also  regularly host workshops, tutorials, and develop learning materials on various topics such as data visualization, statistical analysis with R, and creating online experiments using jsPsych. I also like creating tools to help researchers with data analysis.

If you would like to collaborate on some projects, feel free to contact me at winsonfz.yang@gmail.com. I would be more than happy to work on projects together. If you would like to learn more about meditation, I am more than willing to share my thoughts with you too!
